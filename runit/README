The initial configuration is kept as close as possible to the default sysvinit configuration.
This means by default it starts agetty 1-6, klogd, syslogd, crond and dhcpcd.

To change TIMEZONE, HOSTNAME, FONT or KEYMAP edit /etc/runit/config.
Services with symlinks in /service, to their respective directories are started at boot.

To change the behaviour of services, edit their run/finish scripts in their service-directories in /etc/sv.
Create your own service-directories or install the runit-services package for a collection of service-directories for different applications.

To further adjust runit to your needs edit /etc/runit/{1,2,3}.
/etc/runit/1 contains one-time initialization tasks and the contents of the default /etc/rc and /etc/rc.modules, it also sets up net loopback.
/etc/runit/2 contains /etc/rc.fix and /etc/rc.local and starts the default services.
/etc/runit/3 is called at shutdown and is modeled after /etc/rc.shutdown.

To completely replace sysvinit and rc, remove those two packages and install the runit-initrc package.
